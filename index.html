    <span><p class="myriamB">Myriam's Wall</p></span><p class="myriamQ">Hi Myriam, thanks so much for meeting with me today, would you mind briefly introducing yourself to begin with. </p> 
    
<p class="myriam">
    Hi yes, My name is Myriam and I am from Senegal located in West Africa. I am a graphic designer. I am currently a student at Parsons doing my MPS in communication design.</p>


<p class="myriamQ">
    How long have you lived in the states for?</p>

<p class="myriam">
   I would say two years.</p>

<p class="myriamQ">
    Okay, what interface have you chosen to discuss?</p>

<p class="myriam">
   I have chosen Facebook. At first I used it as a diary, an open diary to my friends where I would keep them updated aboiut my wherabouts uhm so I would post about uhm the my activities and my state of mind. Yeah.</p>
   
   <p class="myriamQ">
  And um do you remember the first time you encountered this interface?</p>

<p class="myriam">
  Yeah , I was thirteen, my best friend was already on the platform and she encouraged me to join join it so I created my account and then eh I my first post was something basic like “Hi everyone.”</p>
  
     <p class="myriamQ">
 Nice yeah I remember the exact same thing... Ehmmmm
What did it feel like to use it? </p>

<p class="myriam">
  Uhmmm at first I remember feeling confused about the trem “write... write on your wall” uhm cause we were on the web and uh it was confusing to me and second, I was feeling kind of scared to expose myself to everyone but then I realised everyone was doing the same thing too. </p>
  
      <p class="myriamQ">
Yeah I think we all got indoctinated quite quickly... </p>

<p class="myriam">
 Yeah.</p>
   
       <p class="myriamQ">
Ehm, what else comes to mind when you think about facebook. </p>

<p class="myriam">
Yeah so as I said at first it was about displaying my thoughtsbut then it was .. it turned to a way to stay connected to my friends as I moved out of the country so I just ahhhh... we just kept in touch through private message instead of uhm publishing something on eachothers walls.</p>
  
  
   
      <p class="myriamQ">
Yeah that makes sense</p>

<p class="myriam">
 Yeah.</p>
  
  
      <p class="myriamQ">
Ehm, Do other faces.... do other interfaces... Are there other interfaces like this one?</p>

<p class="myriam">
Ehm yeah any platform which leads to displaying ones lives or thoughts like instagram or twitter. </p>
  
  
        <p class="myriamQ">
And uhm does facebook still exist?</p>

<p class="myriam">
It does exist but I am not there anymore. </p>
  
        <p class="myriamQ">
It doesnt exist in the same way that it did maybe?</p>

<p class="myriam">
Exactly yeah </p>
  
          <p class="myriamQ">
Do you think its sort of served its purpse?</p>

<p class="myriam">
It has. It’s not my purpose anymore. I just changed.  </p>
